# TODO List
This is a list of tasks that need to be revisited
at a later date.

- Fix collisions, plance seems to collide against the 
  center of the hit circles
- (Maybe) change status code returned when a 
  non-websocket connection is made to something
	other than 418 (e.g. redirect to server page)
- Limit firing rate of missiles, even if the player
  has enough energy to shoot
