# Improvements

This file details a list of possible inprovements
that can be done with an airmash server.

### Protocol

 - Use [WebRCT](https://webrtc.org/) as a primary 
 channel for communications.

### Anti-Cheat

- Do not send mimimap positions of prowlers that
are nearby to the current player (counters prowler
radar) (not sure if this is an improvement)

### Prowlers
Multiple ideas here
- Prowlers aren't visible to anyone, not own team,
  not other prowlers
- Don't send minimap updates for nearby prowlers,
  can also be based on external situations such
	as when the flag is out of base

### Missions?
- Give new players easy missions that help the
  team tactically
	
### Missile Interactiosn
- Missiles "push" friendly players
- Missiles can shoot other missiles out of the air
- Friendly fire
